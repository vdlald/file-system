SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
The utility allows you to create and manage a file system (fs) in a single file.

     The options are as follows:

     --operation=what_to_do      
             It's required.
             Allows you to specify which operation to perform on the file system: 
             "create-file-system" - create file system, 
             "create-file" - create file in fs, "read-file" - read file from fs, 
             "update-file" - update file in fs, "delete-file" - delete file in fs.

     --fs=path
             Allows you to specify the path to the file system. When 
             --operation=create-file-system allows you to specify in which file 
             to create a file system, and in other cases specifies which file with 
             the file system the operation will be performed on.

     --init-size=num
             Allows you to specify how much space should be reserved for the file 
             system in advance.

     --filename=path
             When creating a file, allows you to specify the name of the file to 
             be created, and in other cases indicates the file in the file system 
             to be operated on

     --file_in=path
             Allows you to specify from which file to read content when creating 
             a file in the file system

EXIT STATUS
The sfs utility exits with one of the following values:

     0     Operation successfully completed.
     >0    An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
The command:

           sfs --operation=create-file-system --fs=./filesystem

     will create a file system with initial default size at "./filesystem".

     The command:

           sfs --operation=create-file --fs=./filesystem --filename=some --file_in=../cat1.png

     a file "cat1.png" will be created in the "./filesystem" file system with 
     content from the "../cat1.png" file.
