# Task

Implement a file system (FS) based on a single file (all data must be stored within a single file):

# Requirements

There should be support for at least:
[x] creating
[x] reading
[x] deleting
[x] updating files

[ ] There should be a documented API for working with the file system
[ ] The code must be close to production quality, including tests.

[x] For implementation, please use Java
[x] Preferably, please do not use any third-party libraries for the implementation of file storage itself.

# Questions

[x] Q-1. Will it be enough to provide just a Java interface with Javadoc or do I need to provide an OpenAPI contract?
It would be great to see a console app, but Java interface with Javadoc will be sufficient

[x] Q-2. Do I need to optimize the space used when deleting a file?
It’s up to you if you want to optimize the used space

[x] Q-3. Should the file system be created with a specific size or unlimited?
File system should not have a hard size limit but let’s assume that users won’t stress it beyond some reasonable limits

[x] Q-4. The result should be a mini library? Or assume it's part of the application and I can use spring and so on?
It would be great to see a console app, but Java interface with Javadoc will be sufficient

[x] Q-5. Should the file system be hierarchical?
Up to me

[x] Q-6. Fast write or fast read?
As for the fast write/fast read - let’s assume that we want balance between reads and writes
